# world-billionaires-data
## Overview
This dataset contains the data to 475 millionaires in the world. I go through the data totry and understand things like:
1. Which country has the most Billionaires,
2. Genderwise, of the 475 Billionaires, what is the ratio between men and women,
3. Who are the top 10 Billionaires in the world,
4. Which industry has produced most billionaires,
5. What ages are most billionaires.

I also provide filters in a the dashboard to help the user toggle and understand the relationship between the different fields i.e. gender, industry, age etc.

## Process
### 1. Data Cleaning and Standardization
- Dropping Duplicates
- Reformatting column data
- Performing calculations on things such as age

### Data Analysis
- Use of pivot tables to group data which I later use for visualization.
  - Sorting Pivot Table data
  - Filtering Pivot Table data
  - Grouping Pivot Table data
 
### Data Visualization
- I use Bar charts, Piecharts, Treemaps and other shapes to create a proper dashboard for visualization.
  - Use of slicers to create filters for the different charts in the dashboard.
 
## Conclusion
### Insights Gotten from the Data
1. United states leads in billionaires count generally. It's followed by China.
2. There's a higher percentage of men Billionaires than there are women.
3. Many billionaires start from the age of 40 onwards. There are only a few (4) who are below the age of 40.
   - Most billionaires fall uneder the age of 60-70 years (133).
